Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring Toolkit (nilmtk)

Below is an illustration of what NILM, in general, can do.  Please note that nilmtk cannot do this yet!  But we hope that it will do soon!
This image is from the following paper and since the main author is contributing to nilmtk, so no permission issues.

#####Current state of the project

The project is in the very, very earliest stages.  *It does not do anything useful yet!*  If you'd like to help design the architecture please jump into the [issue queue](https://github.com/nilmtk/nilmtk/issues).  Otherwise, if you want something usable, then please check back in a month or two ;)
