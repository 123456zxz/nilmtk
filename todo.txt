* Stats:
  * check proportion_of_energy_submetered agrees with v0.1 for REDD

* Metrics
  * TODO in combinatorial_optimisation (mostly metadata IIRC)


Blog
* Background to NILMTK v0.2 (going on holiday)
* Future: high freq, metrics, better algos, Hart's stuff, more tests,
more importers, WikiEnergy importer...

Release

* change nilmtk.github.io.  Remove "Import 6 public data sets" and
change image. Remove FHMM
* Merge develop into master
* Tag with v0.2
* Delete develop
* Go through issue queue and close irrelevant issues
* Tweet and mention on mailing list.  Also email:
  * Simon (he could use NILMTK?)
  * Zico
  * Mark Taylor
  * SmartB
  * Navetas
  * Update recent issues where I said 'wait for NILMTK v0.2'

Add to todo on wiki:

* train_test_split (see nilmtk.cross_validation.train_test_split in v0.1)
* load only required measurements
* automatically decide size of chunk
* Do we still need Hashable?  Try making ElecMeter and Appliance
  inherit from Object.
* stats.totalenergy._energy_for_chunk looks wasteful. Why not, for
  each AC type, find cumulative energy > energy > power and then
  only run _energy_for_power_series on one column per AC type.
* FHMM (Nipun might do this)
