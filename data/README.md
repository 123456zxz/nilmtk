These data files are used during unit testing.

There are some .h5 files in the `read_only` directory.  These are
generated by `nilmtk.tests.generate_data.create_all()`.  We do not
generate these files very often (just when the design of the file
structure changes).

When nosetests runs, it runs the `setup_package()` function in
`nilmtk/__init__.py` which copies the *.h5 files from
`nilmtk/data/read_only` to `nilmtk/data`.  The tests then use the *.h5
files in the `nilmtk/data` directory.  When nosetests finishes, it
runs `teardown_package()` in `nilmtk/__init__.py` which deletes
`nilmtk/data/*.h5`.  The reason we do this little dance is because the
tests modify the `nilmtk/data/*.h5` files (by testing and then
clearing the stats cache in these files) which confuses git.  So we
keep non-changing files in `nilmtk/data/read_only` and copy them every
time nosetests runs.

If you want to run individual tests without using nosetests then
manually copy `nilmtk/data/read_only/*.h5` to `nilmtk/data/`.
