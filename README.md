#####Current state of the project

The project is in the very, very earliest stages.  *It does not do anything useful yet!*  If you'd like to help design the architecture please jump into the [issue queue](https://github.com/nilmtk/nilmtk/issues).  Otherwise, if you want something usable, then please check back in a month or two ;)

`python setup.py install`

(you may have to run as `sudo`)

If you want to get involved in development then:

`python setup.py develop`

#####Software Dependencies
