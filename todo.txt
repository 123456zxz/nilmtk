* modify nodes so they store an upstream node and pull data straight
  from it.. I think I've finished totalenergy, totalenergyresults and clip
* stats nodes need to keep a `results` attribute for combined results,
* results classes need an 'as_dict()' method.  Done totalenergyresults
* change tests
* Add notes to TODO:
  * load only required measurements
  * automatically decide size of chunk
  * Do we still need Hashable?  Try making ElecMeter and Appliance
    inherit from Object.
  * stats.totalenergy._energy_for_chunk looks wasteful. Why not, for
    each AC type, find cumulative energy > energy > power and then
    only run _energy_for_power_series on one column per AC type.
